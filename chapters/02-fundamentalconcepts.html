        <h1>2. Fundamental Concepts</h1>

        <section>
          <p>
            What is a computer?
          </p>
          <p>
            This sounds like a simple question, but it cuts to the heart of what we do as programmers.
            For now, let's just say that a "computer" is anything that executes a program. A "program"
            is just a series of instructions, and executing a program means starting at the beginning
            of the series of instructions and following them one-by-one. (If you read a program and
            follow the instructions yourself, congratulations! You are a computer!)
          </p>
          <p>
            Every computer has a specific set of instructions that it knows how to follow. We call
            this set of instructions a computer's <em>instruction set</em> (very creative, I know).
            There are a number of ways to represent an instruction set, but for now let's assume
            that the instructions in the instruction set are represented by numbers. So, a program
            is just a list of numbers, each one defining a certain action to perform. Here's a
            hypothetical example instruction set:<label for="turtle-graphics" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="turtle-graphics" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              This is basically the instruction set for Logo, a "turtle graphics" programming language
              that lets you direct a robot with a pen to move over a sheet of paper and create
              interesting designs.<br><br>
              <img src="/img/turtlegraphics.jpg" alt="A turtle robot"><br>

            </span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1: move forward</li>
            <li>2: turn left</li>
            <li>3: turn right</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A program running on a computer with this instruction set that moves forward three times,
            turns right, moves forward twice, turns left, and moves forward four times would look like this:
          </p>
          <pre class="code">1 1 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 1 1</pre>


          <h2>Working with Data</h2>

          <p>
            Often the instructions that the computer needs to execute take some form of <em>data</em> as
            well. A common thing that computers do is add numbers together; it is much simpler to have
            one instruction that adds rather than a whole set of instructions like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1: add 1</li>
            <li>2: add 2</li>
            <li>3: add 3</li>
            <li>4: add 4</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Or, alternatively, a single "add 1" instruction that you have to call multiple times, which
            would be equally difficult to use. A program that adds 1,000 to a number would take 1,000
            times as much storage space (and take 1,000 times as long to execute) as a program that just
            added 1!
          </p>
          <p>
            The data that goes with an instruction has to be part of the program, somewhere. Different
            programming languages take different approaches to this problem. Some programming languages
            require you to keep "code" (instructions) and data completely separate, while others
            combine the two. Each approach has its pros and cons, but for now let's look at combined
            instructions and data.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our hypothetical "add some numbers" computer, the instruction set might look like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1: store next number as "first number"</li>
            <li>2: add next number to first number, if stored</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A program that adds the numbers 2 and 7 would look like this:
          </p>
          <pre class="code">1 2 2 7</pre>
          <p>
            Stepping through the program one number at a time, we see the instruction "1",
            "store the next number as first number". The next number is "2", so 2 is stored as
            the first number. We then see the instruction "2", "add next number to first number".
            The next number is "7", so our program adds 7 to 2, with the result being 9. Here the
            data and instructions are intermixed. Seeing "1 2 2 7", it is impossible to know which
            "2"s are the instruction "add next number to first number" and which are the literal
            number "2" without starting at the beginning and stepping through the entire program.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where does the result (9) live? How do we do anything with the result later in our
            program? And what does it mean to "store" something?
          </p>
          <h2>Processor Registers</h2>
          <p>
            As we have just seen, programs often need a place to temporarily store some data.
            Most computers accomplish this by providing <em>registers</em> - small places inside
            the processor that can each hold one value.<label for="values-are-numbers" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="values-are-numbers" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              "Values" here are really just numbers; as we've done with instructions in the instruction
              set, we can take any kind of value and represent it with a number as long as we have
              some kind of mapping between the numbers and the things they represent. As an example,
              Unicode represents every possible character, from every writing system on Earth, with
              a 32-bit number. (More on "bits" in just a bit.)
            </span> Registers can be fully generic, or they can be tied to specific kinds of
            functionality. The NES' processor, for example, has a register called the <em>accumulator</em>,
            often abbreviated to "A", that handles all math operations. The 6502's instruction set
            has instructions that work like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>store next number in accumulator</li>
            <li>add next number to accumulator, result in accumulator</li>
            <li>put number from accumulator somewhere</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This solves the problem of where to put numbers and how to access them. But there is
            still one open question: when we "put number from accumulator somewhere", where is
            "somewhere"? The 6502 in the NES only has three registers, so complicated programs
            like games can't use <em>only</em> registers for storing results.
          </p>

          <h2>Memory</h2>
          <p>
            Computers make available to programs some amount of (non-permanent) memory to store
            things temporarily, allowing the computer to have a small number of (expensive) registers
            while still allowing for a reasonable amount of values to be stored outside of the program
            itself. This memory is made available as a series of register-sized boxes, each holding one
            value and referred to by number. The NES provides your program with two kilobytes (2KB) of
            memory space, numbered from zero to 2,047 - a memory space's number is referred to as
            its <em>address</em>, just like a house number. So, the 6502 instruction set we looked
            at above is really more like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>store next number in accumulator</li>
            <li>add next number to accumulator, result in accumulator</li>
            <li>put number from accumulator into memory address of next number</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Representing Data</h2>
          <p>
            This leads to our final question for this chapter - how are all of these numbers
            represented inside the computer?
          </p>
          <p>
            Up to this point, we have been using "standard", decimal (base 10) numbers. These
            are the kinds of numbers that we use every day - numbers like "2" or "7" or "2,048".
            Computers, however, operate through electrical currents that can either be "on" or
            "off", with no in-between. These currents form the basis of all data inside the
            computer, and as a result computers use binary (base 2) numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The smallest unit of information a computer can process is a "bit", or "binary
            digit". A bit stores one of two values - 0 or 1, "on" or "off". If we combine
            more than one bit as a single number, we can represent a larger range of values.
            Two bits, for example, can represent four different values:
          </p>
          <pre class="code">00 01 10 11</pre>
          <p>
            Three bits let us represent eight different values:
          </p>
          <pre class="code">000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111</pre>
          <p>
            Each bit we add allows us to represent twice as many values, in the same way
            that each decimal digit we add to a decimal number lets us represent ten times
            as many values (1 &#8594; 10 &#8594; 100 &#8594; 1,000). Eventually, we reach
            eight bits working together to represent a single value, which is so common
            that it has its own name: a <em>byte</em>. A byte can store one of 256 values.
            Since four bits is half of a byte, it is occasionally referred to as a <em>nybble</em>,
            which is incredibly cute. A nybble can hold one of 16 values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computers, including video game consoles, are often described as being a certain
            number of bits. Modern desktop/laptop computers are generally "64-bit", older versions
            of Windows like Windows XP are called "32-bit operating systems", and the NES is
            an "8-bit" system. What all of these are referring to is the <em>register size</em>
            of the computer - how many bits a single register can hold at one time.
            <label for="address-bus" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="address-bus" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Slightly complicating things, the NES' <em>address bus</em> is actually 16 bits
              wide, meaning the NES can deal with 65,536 different memory addresses instead
              of just 256. Each memory address still only holds one byte, though.
            </span>
            Since the NES is an "8-bit" computer, its registers each hold an 8-bit value
            (one byte). Additionally, each memory address can hold one byte.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do we work with numbers larger than 255? It is not uncommon for someone playing
            <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> to get a score in the tens of thousands, far too large
            a number to represent in one byte. When we need to represent a value that is
            larger than what one byte can hold, we use more than one byte. Two bytes
            (16 bits) can hold one of 65,536 different values, and as we add more bytes
            our representational power increases sharply. Three bytes can store a value
            up to 16,777,215, and four bytes can store a value up to 4,294,967,295. When
            we use more than one byte in this way, we are still limited by the register size
            of the computer. To work with a 16-bit number on an 8-bit system, we need to
            fetch or store the number in two parts - the "low" byte on the right, and the
            "high" byte on the left.<label for="endianness" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="endianness" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Dealing with these larger-than-one-register values is why processors have a defined
              <em>endianness</em> - i.e., which byte comes first when dealing with large numbers.
              "Little-endian" processors, like the 6502, take the low byte first followed by the
              high byte. "Big-endian" processors, like the Motorola 68000, do the opposite, expecting
              the high byte to come first followed by the low byte. Most modern processors are
              little-endian, since Intel's hugely popular x86 architecture is little-endian.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the 6502 that powers the NES works with eight bits of data at a time, smaller
            numbers still take eight bits to represent. This can be inefficient, so it is common
            to represent multiple smaller values in a single byte when needed. One byte can
            hold two four-bit numbers, or four two-bit numbers, or even eight individual
            on/off values (we call these "<em>flags</em>").
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, the byte <code>10110100</code> could represent:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>One 8-bit value: 180</li>
            <li>Two 4-bit values: 11 (<code>1011</code>) and 4 (<code>0100</code>)</li>
            <li>Four 2-bit values: 2 (<code>10</code>), 3 (<code>11</code>), 1 (<code>01</code>), and 0 (<code>00</code>)</li>
            <li>Eight on/off (or true/false) values: on, off, on, on, off, on, off, off</li>
            <li>Any other combination of bit lengths that add up to eight</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To help us talk about these multiple-values-in-one-byte scenarios, it's common to number
            the bits inside a byte, much like how we can name the "low" and "high" bytes in a
            16-bit value. The bit on the far right is "bit 0", and bits count up toward "bit 7"
            on the far left. Here's an example:
          </p>
          <pre class="code">
byte:  1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
bit #: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
          </pre>

          <h2>Making Data Human-Readable</h2>
          <p>
            As we have seen, bytes are a very flexible way to represent a variety of
            data types in a computer system. The downside of using bytes, though, is
            that they are difficult to read. It takes work to see "10110100" and
            mentally translate it to the decimal number "180". When an entire program
            is represented as a series of bytes, the problem is made exponentially
            worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve this problem, most code is represented as <em>hexadecimal</em> numbers.
            "Hexadecimal" is a fancy way of saying "base 16"; a single hexadecimal ("hex")
            digit can hold one of sixteen values. Here are the numbers from zero to fifteen
            represented in hexadecimal:
          </p>
          <pre class="code">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f</pre>
          <p>
            Hex notation is useful because a hex digit and a nybble store the same range
            of values. This means we can represent a byte using two hex digits, a much
            more compact and easy-to-read representation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dealing with numbers that could be decimal, binary, or hexadecimal can
            be confusing. The number "10", for example, represents 10 if it is
            decimal, 2 if it is binary, or 16 if it is hexadecimal. To make clear
            what value we are referring to, the convention is to use prefixes.
            <code>10</code> is a decimal number, <code>%10</code> is a binary number,

          <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we've covered a wide range of topics related to how computers
            (and programs) work, let's take one more look at the entire process
            of what happens when you run a program.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, the program itself is represented as a series of bytes (what we call
            <em>machine code</em>). Each byte is either an instruction for the processor,
            or a piece of data that goes with an instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The processor starts at the beginning of the program and repeatedly carries
            out a three-step process. First, the processor <em>fetches</em> the next
            byte from the program. The processor has a special register called the
            <em>program counter</em>, which keeps track of what byte number of the
            program is next. The program counter (or "PC") works together with a
            register called the <em>address bus</em>, responsible for retrieving
            and storing bytes from the program or from memory, to fetch bytes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, the processor <em>decodes</em> the byte it fetched, figuring out
            which entry in its instruction set the byte corresponds to (or which instruction
            the data byte goes with). Finally, it <em>executes</em> the instruction,
            which will make changes to the processor registers or memory. The processor
            increments the program counter by one to fetch the next byte of the program,
            and the cycle begins again.
