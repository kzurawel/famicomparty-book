            In broad terms, the NES (“Nintendo Entertainment System”) is a home
            video game console designed to connect to a CRT television. It uses
            interchangeable, read-only cartridges (“Game Paks”) to store games,
            since the system has no permanent means of storage. Input comes in
            the form of two controller ports on the front of the system; the
            standard NES controller has a 4-way, cross-shaped directional pad
            and four additional buttons, labelled Start, Select, A, and B.

						The NES was first released in the U.S. in 1985; no one is sure
						exactly when, but most sources estimate it was in October of that year.
						Nintendo continued to sell the NES in the U.S. until 1995, well past the launch
						of its successor, the Super NES, in 1991. During that ten-year period, nearly
						700 officially-licensed games were released for the NES, produced both by
						Nintendo directly and by a wide range of third-party developers like Konami and
						Capcom. It was the best-selling video game console of its
            generation,<label for="sheff-gameover" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

            The NES did not spring fully-formed from a Nintendo R&amp;D lab. A
            unique series of failures and innovations led to the system
            becoming a powerhouse in the home video game space. So, before we
            start to work with the NES, it is important to take a step back and
            discuss where the system came from. The historical background that
            led to the NES had important implications for the system’s design
            and capabilities, which will ultimately impact the games that can
            (and can't) be made for the system.

          <h2>The American Experiment</h2>
          <p>
            Nintendo began in 1889 in Kyoto, Japan, as a hanafuda playing
            cards manufacturer.<label for="kohler-nintendo-history" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

						</span>
            When Hiroshi Yamauchi, the great-grandson of
            company founder Fusajiro Yamauchi, took over the business in 1949, he
            began to expand the company’s product line, diversifying into new
            areas like taxi services, love hotels, and toys like the Ultra Hand.

						</span>
            Nintendo would not find breakout success until it began creating
            electronic toys. Nintendo began producing the Color TV-Game series of home
            “Pong”-clone video game consoles in 1977, and in 1980, they released the
            “Game &amp; Watch” series of handheld video games.<label for="high-score" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>

            Nintendo had released a few arcade games by this point, the most
            successful being 1979’s <em>Radar Scope</em><label for="radar-scope" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>

, a space shooter game that was
            the #2 arcade game in Japan behind Namco’s Pac-Man.<label for="ultimate-history" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="ultimate-history" class="margin-toggle">

            </span> By 1978,
            Namco had already found great success in American arcades, and
            Taito had licensed its wildly-popular Space Invaders to Midway for
            the U.S. market as well. Nintendo knew that the American market
            presented a huge opportunity, but it would need to compete with
            both its Japanese rivals as well as American arcade companies like
            Atari.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi thought Radar Scope would be an
            excellent way to start a Nintendo U.S. branch. In 1980, he gave his
            son-in-law, Minoru Arakawa, instructions to rent office and
            warehouse space for a new “Nintendo of America”, and shipped him 3,000
            Radar Scope machines from Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, waiting nearly a year to begin shipment of Radar
            Scope machines&mdash;plus the extra two weeks it took for them to get
            from the west coast to Arakawa’s New Jersey warehouse&mdash;meant that
            Radar Scope looked and felt dated, and American buyers were not
            particularly interested. Arakawa’s sales team were only able to
            sell about 1,000 Radar Scope machines, with the rest sitting in the
            warehouse gathering dust.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a serious problem for Nintendo. In the early 1980’s,
            2,000 arcade machines represented a substantial amount of money.
            For the sake of comparison, during this time period Atari would
            provide interested customers
            with a “Project Materials Cost Estimate” detailing the parts
            required for an arcade cabinet and their costs. A typical Atari
            arcade game like Missile Command contained $871 in parts, and
            would sell to an arcade or bar for $1,995.<label for="arcadeblogger" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="arcadeblogger" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              For much more detail on the arcade business of the early '80's, see <a href="https://arcadeblogger.com/2016/05/13/arcade-factory/"><em>Tales from the Arcade Factory Floors</em></a>.
            </span>In 2018 dollars,
            that would be equivalent to about $2,695 in parts for a selling
            price of $6,170. 2,000 unsold arcade machines therefore
            represented over five million dollars (2018 equivalent) in sunk
            costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hiroshi Yamauchi had an idea: what if Nintendo designed a new game
            that could re-use the majority of Radar Scope’s components,
            something more appealing to American buyers? Yamauchi set aside
            $100,000 (1980 dollars) for the project, and handed
            responsibility for coming up with the new game to a young designer
            who had previously worked on the exterior shell of the Color
            TV-Game series. That designer was Shigeru Miyamoto,<label for="shigeru-miyamoto" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="shigeru-miyamoto" class="margin-toggle">

            </span> who would later
            become famous as the creator of Mario, Link, and many more of
            Nintendo’s most famous game characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Miyamoto created a game that featured a fearless carpenter whose girlfriend had
            been captured by a large ape. His inspirations included the comic strip Popeye
            and the classic film King Kong. The result was <em>Donkey Kong</em>.<label for="donkey-kong" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="donkey-kong" class="margin-toggle">

              <em>Donkey Kong</em>.
            </span> To make the game
            more “American”, Nintendo of America named the hero “Mario” (after warehouse
            landlord Mario Segale), and named the hero's girlfriend “Pauline”. Donkey
            Kong was enormously popular, both in the U.S. and Japan, and it set up
            Nintendo as an arcade powerhouse.
          </p>

          <h2>The Home Market</h2>
          <p>
            The success of the Radar-Scope-to-Donkey-Kong conversion project also led
            to another great idea: a home system which, like a Radar Scope cabinet,
            could run different game software on the same hardware. Home video game systems
            up to this point had been single-use machines, often built to play just
            one game (potentially with variants on a theme). Nintendo's own Color TV-Game
            could play six or fifteen varieties of Pong, depending on which model the user
            purchased, but nothing else. The most versatile system of the era was the
            Magnavox Odyssey, which could play over a dozen games by swapping out "game cards"
            included with the system. The cards did not contain any actual game data, though;
            they merely activated different parts of the system's internal circuitry, meaning
            the Odyssey's future expansion was extremely limited. The proposed Nintendo
            home system would operate the same way the arcade Donkey Kong machine did:
            game code would live on chips separate from the main processing components,
            with no pre-programmed game code on the system itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was one major obstacle to creating such a system: cost. Video games, especially
            for the home, were marketed to families with children as a fun way to spend time
            together. If the machine were too expensive, parents would not consider buying
            it, no matter how good its games were. No parent would be willing to spend $871
            for a home system, so Nintendo R&amp;D had to find a way to make the
            Donkey Kong arcade cabinet for less. Yamauchi's goal was a system powerful enough
            to play Donkey Kong in the home, but able to sell for a mind-boggling &yen;9,800
            (equivalent to about $40 USD).
          </p>
          <p>
            To meet that price target, Nintendo R&amp;D started with the system's processor. The
            Donkey Kong arcade machine used, at its core, a Zilog Z80 processor<label for="zilog-z80" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="zilog-z80" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              <img src="/img/Z80.png"><br>
              A Zilog Z80 processor.
            </span>, developed by a
            group of former Intel engineers who attempted to take all of the great features
            of the Intel 8080 series of processors and implement them in a smaller, faster,
            and cheaper package. The Z80 was everywhere in the Japanese computer market, powering
            the "MSX" standard for home computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nintendo was unable to find a manufacturing partner that would agree to its strict
            requirements, however. The only Japanese company desperate enough to sign a deal with Nintendo
            was Ricoh. Ricoh was utilizing only 10% of its chip manufacturing capability at the
            time, so to increase business it agreed to provide Nintendo with three million processors, purchased up-front.
            Nintendo was going all-in on their home console bet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ricoh, however, did not have a license to manufacture the Z80. Securing that license
            would be costly and take a long time, so Ricoh instead offered an alternative: why
            not use the MOS Technologies 6502 instead?<label for="mos-6502" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="mos-6502" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              <img src="/img/MOS6502.jpg"><br>
              The MOS Technologies 6502.<br>
              Photo by Dirk Oppelt, CC-BY-SA
            </span> Ricoh already had a license to manufacture the 6502, an 8-bit processor with a
            similar performance profile to the Z80. As an added bonus, it was relatively unknown
            in Japan (despite powering the Apple II, Commodore 64, Atari VCS, and many other
            computers popular in the West). Adopting the 6502 as the core of their new system
            would grant Nintendo a type of copy protection, since games written for Nintendo's
            system would not be easily portable to competitors' systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MOS Technologies 6502 was developed by a group of former Motorola engineers who
            attempted to take all of the great features from the Motorola 6800 series of processors
            and implement them in a smaller, faster, and cheaper package. (Sound familiar?)<label for="bcd-issues" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="bcd-issues" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Ricoh had a license to manufacture the 6502, but it did <em>not</em> have a license
              for the "binary-coded decimal" (BCD) functionality of the chip. To avoid running
              afoul of MOS Technologies, Ricoh's processor cut all electrical connections between the BCD module
              and the rest of the chip. When MOS Technologies was purchased by Commodore, the latter
              attempted to sue Nintendo for license violations but gave up when Commodore engineers
              discovered Ricoh's fix.
            </span> You can still buy 6502-based processors today from Western Design Center (WDC), and they are
            commonly used in industrial applications. The 6502 became available for purchase in 1975,
            meaning it was already ten years old when Nintendo chose to use it in its new home system.
            Individual 6502 processors in 1975 sold for $25 each, and Nintendo's bulk order drove
            the per-processor price even lower.
            Ricoh paired its 6502-based processor with a custom "Picture Processing Unit" (PPU) to handle drawing graphics to the screen.
            The PPU allowed for sophisticated graphics, supporting a 64 color palette, a 256x240 pixel
            resolution display, 64 hardware sprites, and a hardware-scrolling background layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the internals set, all that remained was to design the outer casing of the system and give it a name.
            Nintendo chose to call their new home system the "Family Computer", shortened to "Famicom".<label for="famicom" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="famicom" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">

            </span>
            Its case was
            designed to make it look like a fun toy: red and white, with gold accents. The Famicom had two controllers
            hard-wired to the sides of the console, with a 15-pin expansion port on the front. Game cartridges
            were inserted vertically into a slot on top of the console.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Famicom launched in July 1983 to great success, selling 500,000 consoles in two months despite only
            having three available games &mdash; Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. While
            Nintendo R&amp;D was not able to hit Yamauchi's ambitious &yen;9,800 target, the
            system did sell for &yen;14,800 (equivalent to $65 USD), certainly cheap enough
            to appeal to parents.

        <section>
          <h2>An American Renaissance</h2>
          <p>
            With its popularity in Japan, bringing the Famicom to the U.S. was a no-brainer. But
            the American market was having issues of its own; 1983 was the year of the "Atari Crash"
            in the U.S., when retailers abandoned the idea of home video games after overproduction
            and a lack of quality control led to massive unsold inventories of Atari 2600 cartridges.
            U.S. retailers were not interested in buying inventory of a new video game system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nintendo spent two years re-designing the Famicom for a post-video-game market. It
            could not look like a video game machine, so its outer casing became a grey rectangle
            with a prominent front flap - a move meant to make it look like a VCR. The Famicom's
            small, colorful game cartridges became large, grey "Game Paks", mostly containing
            empty space but now large (and uniform) enough to bear a passing resemblance to VHS tapes.
            Finally, the system needed a name change. "Nintendo Entertainment System" positioned the
            system as part of a home theater setup, something that would fit in alongside stereo
            equipment.

            The re-designed system was almost ready, but Nintendo felt it still needed something unique
            to make it a "must-buy" product. The "Deluxe Set" included a "Zapper" light gun, perfect
            for shooting games like <em>Duck Hunt</em>, and R.O.B., the "Robotic Operating Buddy".<label for="r-o-b" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>

            This was no mere video game system - it came with a <em>robot!</em> The cameras that
            formed R.O.B.'s "eyes" could detect coded patterns of flashing light from the TV,
            which would instruct R.O.B. to turn left or right or move its arms up or down.
            R.O.B. could be used with two games, <em>Gyromite</em> and <em>Stack-Up</em>, neither of which were
            particularly good. But games were secondary: R.O.B. existed solely to sell the NES
            to American parents who had already been burned by the Atari 2600.

            There is one more piece of the Famicom's re-branding to discuss before we move on to
            programming the hardware. A key cause of the 1983 crash was a lack of quality control
            or licensing for Atari 2600 games. Video games were big business, and any company
            that could hire a programmer or two wanted to find a way to sell Atari games. The
            result was a flood of games that often barely worked. Most consumers, after being
            burned a few times by paying full price for terrible games, stopped buying them,
            and the video game market imploded.

            Desperate to prevent this situation for the NES, Nintendo added a chip to the NES
            motherboard called "10NES"<label for="cic-10nes" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>

              The 10NES chip on an NES cartridge.<br>

            </span> (sometimes referred to as "CIC", for "Checking Integrated
            Circuit").
            The 10NES chip acted as a cryptographic lock and key. The console and cartridge each had
            their own CIC chip; the two chips would each calculate a value based on a specific
            algorithm, and the cartridge would send its answer to the console for comparison.
            If the results matched, the system would boot as normal. If they did not match,
            the CIC chip in the console would reset and try again.<label for="cic-resets" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="cic-resets" class="margin-toggle">

              Incidentally, this is why you would often have to "blow on the cartridge" to get
              an NES game to work. If the connectors on the cartridge did not make a secure
              connection to the console, the 10NES chip would be unable to transmit its code,
              and it would go into a reset loop. Blowing on the cartridge
              actually did nothing; what fixed the problem was removing and re-inserting
              the cartridge to re-seat the connectors.
            </span> The design
            of the 10NES chip as well as the specific algorithm running on it were patented
            by Nintendo, meaning that only Nintendo could legally manufacture 10NES chips.
            As a result, only Nintendo could manufacture cartridges that would work with
            the NES &mdash; unlicensed cartridges would not have the chip, and the NES
            console would refuse to boot them. Nintendo would have final say on what games
            were released for its platform.
