        <section>
          <p>
          Sometime in the fall of 1990, my parents gave me a Nintendo Entertainment
          System Action Set: a grey, boxy Control Deck, two controllers, a bright orange
          "Zapper" light gun, and a cartridge that contained both <em>Super Mario
          Bros.</em> and <em>Duck Hunt</em>.
          <label for="nes-console-set" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="nes-console-set" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="marginnote">

          </span>
          The Control Deck plugged into the big CRT TV
          we had in the basement via an RF switch, basically an antenna that fed video
          from the Control Deck to the TV when you tuned it to Channel 3. It was the
          first video game console we had ever owned, and I loved it.</p>

          <p>I spent a lot of time in the basement that year. At first, my dad did too -
          he was working his way through <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, learning where the
          secret Warp Zones were located and how to get past the menacing Hammer Bros.
          Eventually he defeated Bowser (or “the dragon”, as he called him), saved the
          princess, and never really played an NES game ever again.</p>

          <p>
            I was hooked, though. We got a promotional letter in the mail
            offering a free copy of <em>Dragon Warrior</em>
            for subscribing to Nintendo Power magazine; signing
            up for a $20 magazine subscription to get a $50 game was a
            no-brainer.
            <label for="dragon-warrior-box" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="dragon-warrior-box" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              <img src="/img/Dragon_Warrior-box.jpg" alt="Dragon Warrior box"><br>
              Dragon Warrior (US box art).
            </span>
            <em>Dragon Warrior</em> introduced me to RPGs in the
            same way that <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> had introduced me to
            platformers. There were plenty of other games that I spent time
            with, too: <em>Ducktales</em>, <em>Final Fantasy</em>,
            <em>Contra</em>, and <em>Mega Man III</em> were some of my
            favorites.</p>

          <p>The NES ultimately set me on a career path. As a kid, I knew that video
          games were special, and that making video games was what I wanted to do as an
          adult. I had the (mistaken) belief that a career making video games meant a
          career <strong>playing</strong> video games. I started learning C++ once my
          family got a computer because that was what “real” programmers used. (Little
          did I know that NES programmers don't use C++, but in my defense I was young
          and naive.) I never made any actual games, though. Game programming always
          seemed more complicated than I was prepared for, and besides, there was no
          shortage of great games from other people waiting to be played.</p>

          <p>
          That dream stuck with me, and after years of being a professional web
          developer I started learning NES development. (I got a strong nudge in the
          right direction from Nathan Altice’s excellent <em>I Am Error</em>.)
          <label for="i-am-error" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="i-am-error" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="marginnote">
            <img src="/img/i-am-error.jpg" alt="I Am Error, front cover"><br>
            <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/i-am-error"><em>I Am Error</em></a>.
          </span>
          It was hard to know where to begin. There were plenty of resources around the
          internet, but they were all incomplete or inaccurate in some way. I got started
          with bunnyboy's <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=7155">"Nerdy Nights"</a> series on the NintendoAge forums. Then I found
          tepples' <a href="https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template">NROM template</a> on GitHub, and started learning the ca65 assembler.
          After months of struggling to understand PPU writes, attribute tables, and
          scroll registers, it all started to click. I'm glad that I had the experience
          of fighting with these concepts to learn on my own, but I wish that I could
          have had a guide that started from scratch and taught all of the essentials of
          NES development.</p>

          <p>My hope is that the book you are now reading will serve as that guide.</p>
