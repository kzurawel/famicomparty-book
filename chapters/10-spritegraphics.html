        <h1>10. Sprite Graphics</h1>

        <section>
          <p>
            Now that we have talked about the PPU at a high level, we are ready to dive
            into the details of drawing sprites. By the end of this chapter,
            you will know how to create sprite tiles and draw them to the screen.
          </p>

          <h2>Sprite Data</h2>

          <p>
            Internally, the PPU uses 256 bytes of memory to store sprite information. It
            takes four bytes of data to describe a sprite, which is where the limit of
            64 sprites at a time comes from. Those four bytes of data encode the
            following information:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Y position of the top left corner of the sprite (0-255)</li>
            <li>Tile number from the sprite pattern table (0-255)</li>
            <li>Special attribute flags (horizontal/vertical flipping, palette number, etc.)</li>
            <li>X position of the top left corner of the sprite (0-255)</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The third byte (attribute flags) uses its eight bits to store multiple pieces
            of information in a compact format. The eight bits control the following properties
            of a sprite:
          </p>

          <div class="table-wrapper">
            <table>
              <caption>Sprite Attribute Flags</caption>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Bit #</th>

                  <td>6</td>

                <tr>
                  <td>5</td>
                  <td>Sprite priority (behind background if "1")</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>4-2</td>
                  <td>Not used</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>1-0</td>
                  <td>Palette for sprite</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>

          <h2>Object Attribute Memory (OAM)</h2>

          <p>
            The region in PPU memory where sprite data is stored is called
            "Object Attribute Memory", or "OAM". This region of memory is
            different in that there are special MMIO addresses that the CPU
            can use to update the contents of OAM all at once, at high speed.
            Being able to update OAM quickly is a necessity for fast-paced
            games, so that all 64 sprites can move smoothly every frame.
          </p>

          <p>
            To use this high-speed copying, the CPU needs to have all of the sprite
            data ready to go in a contiguous page of memory. (A <em>page</em>
            is a block of 256 bytes.) Generally, this "sprite buffer" is placed
            in CPU memory addresses $0200-$02ff.
            <label for="memory-map-notes" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="memory-map-notes" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              A few things to note about the memory map image here. First, "RAM"
              is listed as extending from $0300-$0800. In reality, the entire
              range from $0000-$0800 is RAM (2KB); the region from $0300-$0800 is just
              the portion of RAM that is not commonly allocated for a specific
              purpose. The space from $0800-$2000 in the memory map is empty
              space - writes to that region of memory will silently fail,
              and reads from that range have undefined behavior. Finally, note
              that the entire area from $8000-$FFFF comes from the PRG-ROM
              chip on the cartridge, including the six bytes that define
              the locations of interrupt handlers.
            </span>
          </p>

            <figcaption>
              A common CPU memory layout for the NES. While it is possible to
              change where in memory some items like the stack or sprite buffer
              are located, this is the most common arrangement.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Within the sprite buffer (and in OAM itself), every four bytes defines
            one sprite. So, the first eight bytes of the sprite buffer look
            like this:

          <h3><code>$2003</code>: OAMADDR and <code>$4014</code>: OAMDMA</h3>

          <p>
            Once we have set up all of the sprite data we want to transfer, we use
            two new MMIO addresses in our code to send all of the sprite data
            to the PPU. <code>OAMADDR</code> is used to set where in OAM we
            want to write to; for all of our projects (and for most commercial
            games), this will always be <code>$00</code>, the beginning of the
            OAM block. <code>OAMDMA</code> initiates the transfer of an entire
            page of memory into OAM. Writing the high byte of a memory address
            to <code>OAMDMA</code> will transfer that page.
          </p>

          <p>
            While it might seem like we only need to write to OAM when something
            has changed, the OAM portion of PPU memory is implemented with
            "dynamic RAM", which means that it is highly unstable and needs to
            be continuously refreshed, even if nothing has changed. In practice,
            this means that we want to write to OAM once per frame of graphics
            (60 times per second).
          </p>

          <h3>Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMI)</h3>

          <p>
            Fortunately, the NES has an easy-to-use system for running code once
            per frame: the Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI). NMI is one of the three
            interrupt vectors the 6502 knows how to handle. The NMI event is triggered
            each time the PPU enters "vblank", which occurs at the end of each
            frame of graphics. "Vblank" stands for "vertical blank"; there is a
            similar "Hblank" or "horizontal blank" as well. To understand what these
            terms mean, we need to look at how the CRT televisions and monitors of
            the era work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Until new technologies like plasma and LCD took over in the mid-2000's,
            most televisions used a technology called "cathode-ray tube" or CRT.
            CRTs work by shooting a beam of electrons through an "electron gun"
            to hit the inside of a phosphorescent screen, which absorbs the energy
            of the electrons and converts it into light. The electron gun sweeps
            across the screen continuously in horizontal lines from top to bottom,
            starting at the top-left corner and ending at the bottom-right corner
            before beginning again. The speed of these sweeps is determined by
            the video signal the television is designed to display. The NTSC standard
            used in the US and Japan calls for 60 frames per second, while the
            competing PAL standard used in Europe uses 50 frames per second.
          </p>

          <p>
            When the electron gun is resetting itself &mdash; either to start
            a new horizontal line from the left edge or when moving from
            bottom right to top left to start a new frame &mdash; the stream of
            electrons is temporarily stopped, so as not to inadvertently cause
            graphical issues. These "blanking periods" are the only times when
            the display on screen is not changing. "Hblank" occurs at the end of
            each horizontal line and is incredibly brief, lasting only 10.9
            microseconds for NTSC. "Vblank" is comparatively much longer, though
            still short: about 1250 microseconds, or 0.00125 seconds.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since Vblank is one of the only times that nothing is being output
            to the screen, and since Hblank is far too short to do meaningful
            work, it is common practice to perform most graphical updates during
            Vblank, i.e. as part of the NMI handler. Currently, the NMI handler
            in the test project looks like this:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">.proc nmi_handler
  RTI
.endproc</code></pre>

          <p>
            <code>RTI</code>, as discussed previously, is the opcode for Return from Interrupt.
            Let's update the NMI handler to copy the memory from $0200-$02ff
            into OAM each time it runs:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">.proc nmi_handler
  LDA #$00
  STA OAMADDR
  LDA #$02
  STA OAMDMA
  RTI
.endproc</code></pre>

          <p>
            A quick review of the assembly we learned back in
            <a href="/chapters/05-6502assembly.html">Chapter 5</a> is in order. On line 2,
            we load the <em>literal</em> value zero into the accumulator.
            <label for="addressing-modes" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="addressing-modes" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              In case you've forgotten: a number given to an instruction like <code>LDA</code>
              is, by default, a memory address. <code>LDA $00</code> means "load
              the accumulator with the value stored at memory address zero".
              Adding a "#" tells the assembler that this is a literal value,
              not a memory address.
            </span>
            On line 3, we store (write) this zero to the OAMADDR address.
            This tells the PPU to prepare for a transfer to OAM starting at byte zero.
            Next, we load the literal value two into the accumulator, and write
            it to OAMDMA. This tells the PPU to initiate a high-speed transfer
            of the 256 bytes from $0200-$02ff into OAM.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to use <code>OAMADDR</code> and <code>OAMDMA</code> in our code,
            we need to update our constants file to include these new constants.
            Here is the updated <code>constants.inc</code>:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">PPUCTRL   = $2000
PPUMASK   = $2001
PPUSTATUS = $2002
PPUADDR   = $2006
PPUDATA   = $2007
OAMADDR   = $2003
OAMDMA    = $4014</code></pre>

          <p>
            We now have a reliable and automated way to keep OAM up to date.
            But where do our sprite graphics come from? As mentioned in the
            last chapter, the CHR-ROM chip in a cartridge holds two pattern
            tables, one for sprites and one for backgrounds. We will need to
            create our own pattern tables to display sprites on screen. This
            is where NESTool comes in handy.
          </p>

          <h2>Using NESTool</h2>

          <p>
            Open NESTool. You should see a screen similar to this:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/nestool.png">
            <figcaption>The main screen of NESTool.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Before we dive into creating sprites, let's take a quick tour of how
            NESTool is organized. The large area on the left half
            of the screen is a sort of canvas that can be used to draw
            backgrounds using tiles from a pattern table. We will not use this
            area until we start discussing background graphics. The right
            half of the interface is broadly divided into pattern tables
            ("Tileset") and palettes.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/nestool-tileset.png">
            <figcaption>The "Tileset" area.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Within the "Tileset" area, the main element is a display of a pattern
            table. Just below the pattern table display are toggle switches for
            "Bank A / Bank B". As mentioned before, generally one pattern table
            is used for sprites, and the other is used for backgrounds. The A/B
            switch lets you flip between the two pattern tables.
            <label for="pattern-table-corruption" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="pattern-table-corruption" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              When opening a brand-new project, NESTool has a known issue where
              switching between banks A and B can cause corruption of the pattern
              tables (random data). I have never seen this issue when opening
              an existing (even blank!) CHR file. Until this issue is resolved,
              I recommend always using an existing CHR file.
            </span>
            There is also a "Grid" button, which will turn on and off a grid
            showing the boundaries of each tile in the pattern table.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/nestool-palettes.png">
            <figcaption>The "Palettes" area.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            The "Palettes" area lets you preview how different palette choices will
            affect your tiles. There are four palettes in a row. Clicking any color
            will change the display of the sprites in the pattern table to the
            palette that color is part of. You can change a color by clicking
            a color in a palette twice, then choosing a color from the popup.
            Hovering over any color in the pop-up will display the hexadecimal
            value the NES uses for that color, as well as the six hex digit
            RGB value of the color (for use in CSS, graphics programs, etc.).
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/nestool-palettes-detail.png">
            <figcaption>Color selection pop-up.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            Changing the first color in the palettes area will change the background
            color of the large canvas area as well as the background of the pattern
            table display.
          </p>

          <h3>Making Your Own Tiles</h3>

          <p>
            To help you get started, I have created a starter .chr file that features
            some basic sprites and a full font in the background table. Download
            <a href="/projects/10-spritegraphics/src/graphics.chr">graphics.chr</a>
            and open it in NESTool ("Tileset" &rarr; "Open CHR..." &rarr; select graphics.chr).
          </p>

          <p>
            To edit or create tiles, double-click on the space in the pattern table
            display for the tile you wish to alter. This will open a separate
            tile-editing window.

          <p>
            To edit a tile (or create new tiles!), select a palette index from
            the four colors below the tile, then click pixels
            in the Edit Tile window to set them to that palette index.
            <label for="changing-palettes" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="changing-palettes" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              Note that clicking on different palettes in the main window changes all
              displayed colors to the colors from that palette. This is extremely useful
              for testing out what your tiles will look like in the palettes used
              by your game.

            Once you have created a set of tiles to work with, save your work by choosing

          <h2>Displaying Sprites In Your Game</h2>

          <p>
            <i>Download the full source code for this example:</i>
            <a href="/projects/10-spritegraphics.zip">10-spritegraphics.zip</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to display our tiles in a game, we first need to make sure
            we load the .chr file that contains them. In our last project, we
            simply reserved 8,192 bytes of empty space for the CHR-ROM chip.
            Now that we have actual tiles, we will load them from a .chr file
            directly. Change the <code>.segment "CHR"</code> section to this:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers"><code class="lang-asm6502">.segment "CHR"
.incbin "graphics.chr"</code></pre>

          <p>
            <code>.incbin</code>, as you might expect, is a new assembler directive
            that instructs ca65 to include raw binary data (as opposed to <code>.include</code>,
            which is processed by the assembler).
            With our tiles in place, it's time to draw something. Here, we will use
            the four "spaceship" tiles from graphics.chr, but feel free to use your own
            tiles instead.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, we will need to fill out an entire palette, instead of just setting
            the first palette color to green (<code>$29</code>). We'll extend <code>.proc main</code>
            as follows:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="20"><code class="lang-asm6502">.proc main
  ; write a palette
  LDX PPUSTATUS
  LDX #$3f
  STX PPUADDR
  LDX #$00
  STX PPUADDR
  LDA #$29
  STA PPUDATA
  LDA #$19
  STA PPUDATA
  LDA #$09
  STA PPUDATA
  LDA #$0f
  STA PPUDATA</code></pre>

          <p>
            Notice that we only have to set an address with <code>PPUADDR</code> once;
            each time we write to <code>PPUDATA</code>, the PPU memory address is
            automatically increased by one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, we need to store the data for our sprites. We are going to start by drawing
            one sprite, the top-left "corner" of the spaceship. As discussed earlier, we
            will store all our sprite information in memory between <code>$0200-$02ff</code>,
            and copy it to the PPU using DMA transfer (in our NMI handler). Let's continue
            modifying <code>.proc main</code> to copy sprite data into <code>$0200-$02ff</code>:
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="35"><code class="lang-asm6502">
  ; write sprite data
  LDA #$70
  STA $0200 ; Y-coord of first sprite
  LDA #$05
  STA $0201 ; tile number of first sprite
  LDA #$00
  STA $0202 ; attributes of first sprite
  LDA #$80
  STA $0203 ; X-coord of first sprite</code></pre>

          <p>
            Finally, we need to make one more change to <code>.proc main</code>. In our
            previous examples, after writing palette data, we turn on the screen by
            writing to <code>PPUMASK</code>. However, now that we are using the NMI
            handler, we need to tell the CPU to generate NMI events. We can do that
            by writing to <code>PPUCTRL</code>, like this:
            <label for="ppuctrl-details" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="ppuctrl-details" class="margin-toggle">
            <span class="marginnote">
              For full details of the possible options that can be set via
              <code>PPUCTRL</code> and <code>PPUMASK</code>, see the
              <a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_registers">NESDev wiki</a>.
            </span>
          </p>

          <pre class="code line-numbers" data-start="45"><code class="lang-asm6502">
vblankwait:       ; wait for another vblank before continuing
  BIT PPUSTATUS
  BPL vblankwait

  LDA #%10010000  ; turn on NMIs, sprites use first pattern table
  STA PPUCTRL
  LDA #%00011110  ; turn on screen
  STA PPUMASK</code></pre>

          <p>
            At this point, our code will draw a single sprite (the top-left
            of the spaceship) to the screen, at X <code>$80</code>
            and Y <code>$70</code> (near the middle of the screen).
            The sprite data that we wrote to CPU memory between <code>$0200-$02ff</code>
            will be copied to PPU memory once per frame by our NMI handler.
            Assembling, linking, and running this code gives the output seen
            below.
          </p>

          <canvas id="sprites-canvas" class="nes-example" width="256" height="240"></canvas>

          <p>
            While this works, our code is very inefficient. To draw all 64 sprites
            this way, we would need 128 lines of code. To make our sprite code
            more manageable, we will store the sprite data separately
            from the code that writes it to memory, and use a loop
            to iterate over the data. This requires a few new assembly opcodes,
            which we will learn next chapter.
